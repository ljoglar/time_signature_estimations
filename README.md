MIR - Time Signature Estimation

Before running the notebooks, make sure to follow these steps:

1 - Download the dataset from here: http://mirg.city.ac.uk/codeapps/the-magnatagatune-dataset.

On said website you'll need to click the links on these lines:
-Audio features extracted by The Echo Nest API 1.0
-Tag annotations collected from game players in CSV format
-Audio data: mp3 32bps file1(1GB) file2(1GB) file3(1GB)

2 - At this point you should have 2 folders and a .csv file. Make sure the folders' names are "mp3_echonest_xml" and "mp3", for features and audio respectively. Leave the .csv as it is.

3 - Lastly, put these two folders and the .csv file ONE directory up from the folder containing the code notebooks (i.e. the parent directory to wherever you put these repo's contents).
